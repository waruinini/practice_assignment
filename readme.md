getting and cleaning data

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set

1, use read.table to read the training and text file into R
2, use function rbind to merge the training and the test sets to a new data set xtrai_test
3, use function apply, mean, sd to extract the mean and standard deviation for each column
4, use descriptive activity names to names the activities in the data set
5, use function gsub to label the data set with descriptive variable names
6, create a new data set called newdata with the average of each variable
7, write the new data set into a file run_analysis.R
